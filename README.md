# My test fixtures

These are the fixtures I use for my minimal Food Computer setup.
The hardware components/capabilities that I intend to start with are:
+ am2315 temperature/humidity sensor
+ mhz16 CO<sup>2</sup> sensor
+ an exhaust fan
+ multiple air circulation fans

### Prequisites

The [OpenAg default.json](https://github.com/OpenAgInitiative/openag_brain/tree/master/fixtures) fixture was loaded before fixtures in this repo.
